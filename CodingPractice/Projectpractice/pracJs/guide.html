<!-- 
Great to hear you already know HTML! Here are some important pointers to keep in mind before creating an HTML document, to ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and accessible:

### 1. **Document Structure**:
   - Always start with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to ensure the browser interprets the document correctly in HTML5 mode.
   - Use the basic structure of `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
   
   Example:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Document Title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       Content goes here 
      </body>
      </html>
      ```
   
   ### 2. **Semantic HTML**:
      - Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<main>` to enhance accessibility and SEO.
      - Avoid using divs and spans for layout purposes unless absolutely necessary.
   
   ### 3. **Meta Tags**:
      - Always include the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag for character encoding.
      - Use the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag for responsive design on mobile devices.
   
   ### 4. **Accessibility**:
      - Add `alt` attributes to all `<img>` elements to describe the image for screen readers.
      - Use ARIA roles and attributes (like `aria-label`, `aria-hidden`) to improve accessibility for assistive technologies.
      - Make sure interactive elements like buttons and links are focusable and navigable by keyboard users.
   
   ### 5. **External Files**:
      - **CSS**: Link external stylesheets inside the `<head>` section using `<link>`.
      - **JavaScript**: Include external JavaScript files at the end of the `<body>` tag using `<script>` to improve page load speed (unless you need the JS to load earlier).
   
   ### 6. **File Organization**:
      - Keep your project files organized by grouping related assets (e.g., styles, scripts, images) into separate directories.
      - Example structure:
        ```
        /index.html
        /assets/css/style.css
        /assets/js/script.js
        /assets/images/
        ```
   
   ### 7. **Validating Code**:
      - Use tools like the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure your HTML is valid and error-free.
      - Fix any errors or warnings that arise to ensure compatibility across browsers.
   
   ### 8. **Use Comments**:
      - Use comments (` comment `) to explain complex code, mark sections, or temporarily disable portions of code.
      
      Example:
      ```html
       Main Content Starts Here 
      ```
   
   ### 9. **Linking CSS and JS**:
      - Always link CSS in the `<head>` section and JavaScript before the closing `</body>` tag for better performance.
      
      Example:
      ```html
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
      <script src="script.js"></script>
      ```
   
   ### 10. **Optimizing Images**:
      - Compress images to reduce file size and improve page load time.
      - Use appropriate file formats (e.g., JPEG for photos, PNG for transparent images, SVG for vector graphics).
      
   ### 11. **Responsive Design**:
      - Use a responsive design approach with CSS media queries.
      - Test your site on different screen sizes and devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops).
   
   ### 12. **Error Handling and Debugging**:
      - Use browser developer tools to debug layout or JavaScript issues (inspect elements, console logs).
      - Validate forms properly using HTML5 form validation attributes like `required`, `pattern`, `min`, and `max`.
   
   ### 13. **SEO Best Practices**:
      - Add meaningful `<title>` and `<meta description>` tags for each page.
      - Use descriptive and unique headings (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) for SEO.
      - Use proper link structure (use `<a href="URL">` and avoid empty links).
   
   ### 14. **Consistency**:
      - Be consistent in your code formatting (indentation, lowercase tags, quotes around attributes).
      - Use a consistent naming convention for CSS classes and IDs.
   
   ### 15. **Cross-browser Compatibility**:
      - Test your HTML in multiple browsers to ensure consistency in appearance and functionality (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
      - Consider using a CSS reset (e.g., Normalize.css) to address inconsistencies across browsers.
   
   ### 16. **Avoid Inline Styles**:
      - It's better to keep styles in a separate CSS file, not directly inside HTML elements via the `style` attribute.
      - This improves maintainability and readability.
   
   By following these guidelines, you’ll be able to create an HTML document that’s both functional and efficient. Is there any particular area you'd like to dive deeper into?

Great question! Using semantic HTML correctly helps improve both accessibility and SEO, while also making your code more readable and easier to maintain. Here's how and when to use **semantic HTML** elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, and heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).

  1. **`<header>`**
     - **When to Use**: The `<header>` tag is used to represent introductory content or navigational links for a page or section.
     - **Where to Use**: 
       - At the top of a webpage, typically inside the `<body>`.
       - Inside individual sections or articles to represent the introductory content for that section.
     - **What It Contains**:
       - Site or page title
       - Navigation links
       - Logo
       - Search form
       
     **Example:**
     ```html
     <header>
         <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
         <nav>
             <ul>
                 <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                 <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                 <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
             </ul>
         </nav>
     </header>
     ```
  
  ### 2. **`<footer>`**
     - **When to Use**: The `<footer>` tag is used to contain footer content at the bottom of the page or section.
     - **Where to Use**: 
       - At the bottom of your webpage or inside a specific section to define the section's footer.
     - **What It Contains**:
       - Copyright information
       - Links to privacy policy, terms of service, and site map
       - Contact information
       - Social media links
  
     **Example:**
     ```html
     <footer>
         <p>&copy; 2025 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
         <ul>
             <li><a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
             <li><a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a></li>
         </ul>
     </footer>
     ```
  
  ### 3. **`<article>`**
     - **When to Use**: The `<article>` tag is used to represent a self-contained, independent piece of content that can be distributed or reused.
     - **Where to Use**: 
       - For blog posts, news articles, product descriptions, or any content that stands alone and has its own meaningful context.
     - **What It Contains**:
       - Title
       - Author or publisher information
       - Date of publication
       - Content (such as paragraphs, images, etc.)
     
     **Example:**
     ```html
     <article>
         <h2>Article Title</h2>
         <p>By <span>Author Name</span> on <time datetime="2025-02-19">February 19, 2025</time></p>
         <p>This is the content of the article...</p>
     </article>
     ```
  
  ### 4. **`<section>`**
     - **When to Use**: The `<section>` tag is used to group content into logical sections, each of which can have a distinct theme.
     - **Where to Use**: 
       - Inside `<article>`, `<main>`, or within the `<body>` to divide the content into meaningful sections, such as different parts of an article or page.
     - **What It Contains**:
       - Subheadings (usually `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for the section
       - Content that relates to the section’s theme
     
     **Example:**
     ```html
     <section>
         <h2>Our Services</h2>
         <p>We offer a variety of web design and development services.</p>
     </section>
     ```
  
  ### 5. **`<main>`**
     - **When to Use**: The `<main>` tag is used to define the central content of the document, and it's unique to the document’s primary topic.
     - **Where to Use**: 
       - Inside the `<body>` to represent the main content of the page, excluding sidebars, footers, or headers. There should only be **one** `<main>` element per page.
     - **What It Contains**:
       - All the primary content relevant to the page. It often includes `<article>`, `<section>`, and other semantic tags.
     
     **Example:**
     ```html
     <main>
         <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
         <section>
             <h2>About Us</h2>
             <p>We are a leading web development company...</p>
         </section>
     </main>
     ```
  
  ### 6. **Heading Tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)**
     - **When to Use**: Heading tags are used to define headings for content. They help structure the document in a hierarchical way and improve SEO.
     - **Where to Use**: 
       - Use `<h1>` for the main heading of the page or article. This is typically the title or main topic.
       - Use `<h2>` for subheadings, `<h3>` for subsections under `<h2>`, and so on.
     - **Best Practices**:
       - There should only be **one** `<h1>` tag per page, typically used for the page’s title.
       - Use `<h2>` to break down sections within the content under `<h1>`, and `<h3>` for further subdivisions, and so on.
     
     **Example:**
     ```html
     <h1>Web Development Services</h1>
     <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
     <p>We build websites that adapt to any screen size.</p>
     <h2>E-Commerce Solutions</h2>
     <p>We provide robust e-commerce platforms for businesses.</p>
     ```
  
  ### How They All Fit Together
  Here's a typical structure that combines these semantic elements:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <header>
          <h1>My Website</h1>
          <nav>
              <ul>
                  <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
              </ul>
          </nav>
      </header>
  
      <main>
          <section>
              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>We are a web development company focused on user experience.</p>
          </section>
          <article>
              <h2>Latest Article: Web Design Trends 2025</h2>
              <p>By John Doe, January 25, 2025</p>

          </article>
      </main>
  
      <footer>
          <p>&copy; 2025 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
      </footer>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
